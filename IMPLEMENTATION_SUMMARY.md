### Key APIs

#### Circuit Building
```rust
let mut column_manager = ColumnManager::new();
let advice_col = column_manager.add_advice_column();
let fixed_col = column_manager.add_fixed_column();

let mut builder = CircuitBuilder::new(CircuitConfig::default());
let gate = StandardGate::new(a_col, b_col, c_col, q_add, q_mul, q_const);
builder = builder.gate(gate.into_gate()?);

let circuit = builder.build()?;
```

#### Proof Folding
```rust
// Fold first proof (creates accumulator)
let result1 = fold_proof(None, proof1, public_inputs1)?;

// Fold second proof with accumulator  
let result2 = fold_proof(Some(result1.accumulator), proof2, public_inputs2)?;
```

#### Commitment Operations
```rust
let params = IpaParams::setup(degree, &mut rng)?;
let commitment = IpaCommitmentEngine::commit(&params, &polynomial, &blinding)?;
let opening = IpaCommitmentEngine::open(&params, &polynomial, &point, &blinding)?;
```
